# Soft Delete Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented soft delete functionality for environments instead of actually deleting them from the database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Model Updates (`environment-database.ts`)

- Added `deletedAt: Date | null` field to `EnvironmentModel` and `EnvironmentModelType`
- Updated model initialization to include the `deletedAt` field with default value `null`

### 2. Database Adapter Methods Updated

- **`loadEnvironments()`**: Now filters out soft-deleted records (`deletedAt: null`)
- **`saveEnvironment()`**: Now handles the `deletedAt` field when saving
- **`deleteEnvironment()`**: Changed from hard delete to soft delete (sets `deletedAt` to current timestamp)
- **`getAllEnvironmentUuids()`**: Now excludes soft-deleted records

### 3. New Database Adapter Methods Added

- **`restoreEnvironment(uuid)`**: Restores a soft-deleted environment by setting `deletedAt` to `null`
- **`loadDeletedEnvironments()`**: Loads all soft-deleted environments
- **`permanentDeleteEnvironment(uuid)`**: Performs actual hard delete from database

### 4. Database Store Updates (`db-environment-store.ts`)

- Updated interface `IEnvironmentDatabase` to include new soft delete methods
- Updated sync logic comment to clarify it's now soft delete
- Added new methods:
  - `getDeletedEnvironments()`: Gets all soft-deleted environments
  - `restoreEnvironment(uuid)`: Restores a soft-deleted environment and reloads state
  - `permanentDeleteEnvironment(uuid)`: Permanently deletes an environment

### 5. Service Updates (`environments-store.service.ts`)

- Updated `remove` action comment to clarify it's now soft delete
- Added new service actions:
  - **`listDeleted`**: Get all soft-deleted environments
  - **`restore`**: Restore a soft-deleted environment
  - **`permanentDelete`**: Permanently delete an environment (hard delete)

## API Usage Examples

### Soft Delete an Environment

```javascript
// This now performs soft delete instead of hard delete
await broker.call('environments-store.remove', { uuid: 'environment-uuid' });
```

### List Soft-Deleted Environments

```javascript
const deletedEnvs = await broker.call('environments-store.listDeleted');
```

### Restore a Soft-Deleted Environment

```javascript
await broker.call('environments-store.restore', { uuid: 'environment-uuid' });
```

### Permanently Delete an Environment

```javascript
// This performs actual hard delete from database
await broker.call('environments-store.permanentDelete', {
  uuid: 'environment-uuid'
});
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Recovery**: Environments can be restored if accidentally deleted
2. **Audit Trail**: Deleted environments remain in the database with deletion timestamp
3. **Better User Experience**: Users can recover from accidental deletions
4. **Gradual Cleanup**: Permanently delete old soft-deleted records as needed

## Database Migration Considerations

- Existing environments will have `deletedAt` as `null` (not deleted)
- The new column will be automatically created when the application starts
- Consider running a cleanup job periodically to permanently delete old soft-deleted records

## Notes

- Regular operations (list, get, etc.) automatically filter out soft-deleted records
- Soft-deleted environments don't appear in normal environment listings
- The `permanentDelete` action should be used with caution as it cannot be undone
